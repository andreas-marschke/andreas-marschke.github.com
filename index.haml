            My name is Andreas Marschke. By day I'm an apprentice for systems integration. 
            But by night I am a freesoftware enthusiast and hacker on a number of different 
            and interesting topics.

            On this page you will find some basic information about who I am what 
            I am interested in and what there is other than this page to find out about me.

          This is a lot of banter for little of facts. Let's get down to some basic facts:

            Thanks to my Job -- and because it tickles my fancy -- I did a reasonable 
            amount programming. Here are a few of the programming languages and respective projects 
            I produced in them:
            .inlist#coding
              %ul
                %li
                  Perl: To me, nothing beats the productivity and speed of development on a daily basis
                  if you just want to punch out a simple script that does something well but is too complex
                  to make it in simple shell. Here are some projects I created:
                  .inlist#perl-coding
                    %ul
                      %li
                        basically everything under
                        %pre
                          perl/
                        in my
                        %a{:href => "https://github.com/andreas-marschke/misc-tools/tree/master/perl"}
                          misc-tools
                        repository on Github. For the most part they are one-offs that where there to do
                        something quickly.
                      %li
                        for work I thought it was a cool idea to have a
                        %a{:href => ""}
                          live graph of our monitoring system
                        churning away on checks for our servers. It actually has a more complex story but this
                        should do for now. 
                      %li
                        Since I like monitoring systems and knowing what is going on in my network I thought I 
                        try playing around with 
                        %a{:href => "http://nmap.org/"}
                          nmap.
                        But since that has only a commandline client and I would like to process stuff coming out
                        of nmap I tried working with tools that would produce something usable. I used Perl for that
                        (obviously). But I was unhappy with the state most of them were in and the features they 
                        provided. Besides the quality of the modules most of them were either dead code or needed a 
                        rewrite to do really fancy stuff with them. So 
                        %a{:href => "https://github.com/andreas-marschke/libnet-nmap-perl"}
                          I built my own.
