# Hi!

My name is **Andreas Marschke**.

I'm a developer with [Akamai Technologies GmbH](https://www.akamai.com/) here in Germany. I work
on [mPulse](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/products/web-performance/mpulse.jsp) as part of the Data
collection team, meaning me and my team are responsible for collection of WebPerformance data and
metrics on the Web and native Mobile Environments.

In my freetime I concern myself with various open source and development projects, administration and
pushing things forward.

## Open Source
A selection of my projects I'm proud to have contributed to or implemented myself:

#### Perl

[Pure Perl implementation of the NRPE Protocol](https://github.com/stockholmuniversity/nagios-nrpe) now maintained by the [University of Stockholm](http://www.su.se/english/)

#### express.js

[Multicast Session Replication](https://github.com/andreas-marschke/express-session-multicast) inspired by Tomcat, implemented for Express

#### Real User Monitoring

[Boomerang](https://github.com/soasta/boomerang) Open Source Real User Monitoring, mainly as contributor and not original author
[Boomerang Express](https://github.com/andreas-marschke/boomerang-express) a Boomerang Beacon Collection agent
