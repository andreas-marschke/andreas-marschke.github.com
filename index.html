		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>Whilst scratching my own itch and solving problems arising over time I created a few projects that I work on in my free time.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img class="icon" alt="hosted on Github.com" src="img/github_alt.png"></img><a href="https://github.com/andreas-marschke/nagplot"><h2 class="hasIcon">nagplot</h2></a>
				<p>After receiving a revelation at work that most of our co-workers that shared on-call jobs with us admins didn't know or see that we had a tool for graphing our servers in place I decided to create nagplot.</p>
				<p>It is meant to be run on bigger screensizes as a live graphing web application to keep an eye on the servers and their current states.</p>
				<p>The plan is to deploy this next to a <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a>/<a href="https://www.icinga.org/">Icinga</a>/<a href="http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/">Shinken</a> installation with a minimum setup and configuration overhead and start graphing your environment as space and time efficient as possible</p>
				<p>The core service is written in Perl and flexible as to what it takes as a backing monitoring infrastructure as long as it is parseable by Perl or even better has Perl bindings.<p>
				<p></p>

		</li>
			<li><img class="icon" alt="hosted on Github.com" src="img/github_alt.png"></img><a href="https://github.com/andreas-marschke/libnet-nmap-perl"><h2 class="hasIcon">Net::Nmap</h2></a>
				<p>A small wrapper around the nmap executable. It is designed to act as much as the normal nmap as possible.</p>
				<p>Modules from within Net::Nmap can be used for themselfs and in conjunction with others.</p>
				<p>My Use-Case was automated network/asset scanning of hosts attached to a network in order to find what services and vulnerabillities they had. </p>
				<p>A handy tool if you suffer from much too much handy work to get up and running on monitoring hnew hosts on your network.</p>

			</li>
			<li><img class="icon" alt="hosted on Github.com" src="img/github_alt.png"></img><h2 class="hasIcon">QBM</h2>
				<p>An alternative init system for unicese. Designed to be very parrelized and ultra fast. Having more the lure of an init system tofor a settop box than
				your average dynamically changing init system.</p>
				<p>Designing a box top to bottom setup to be a replacement HTPC for my livingroom I wanted it to be as fast booting as possible. Munging around in classic
				<code>sysv-init</code> or BSD's <code>rc.d-init</code> was not of interest for me.</p>
				<p>Besides that I felt it was interesting to start and hack on an initsystem for once.</p>

		<h1>Resume</h1>
		<p> If you want to have a full length CV for your company or a customer to peruse please take the one
			on Github <a href="https://github.com/andreas-marschke/Resume/blob/master/resume.tex">Github</a> and 
			build a pdf from it. Or download the <a href="doc/pdf/resume.pdf">PDF</a> version of it here(WARNING: This may
			not be as uptodate as the one on Github).</p>
		<h2> Competencies </h2>
		<ul>
			<h3> Programming Languages </h3>
			<li><p>Programming in a variety of Programming Languages from "C-derived" Languages to "Pascal-derived"
		 			Languages and LISPian dialects. Following is a list of them and what I have used them for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p><em>C:</em> Basic C coding for a basic UNIX init system that is faster and more sufficiant for an HTPC booting quickly and beautifully<p>
						</li>
						<li><p><em>C++:</em> development of GUI applications on a cross plattform basis using Qt and KDE libraries for a variety of tasks.</p></li>
						<li><p><em>C#:</em> used for the development of a virtualized drumpad at that time only available as a hardware device leveraging the .Net 2.0 framework and DirectSound</p></li>
						<li><p><em>JavaScript:</em> used for a live visualization of Data in a perl web project using <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> as an MVC and <a>rickshaw.js</a> as a SVG-Graphing library</p></li>
						<li><p><em>Perl:</em> My personel lingua franca and favourite scripting language. Used for Web/Server/Desktop development mainly with Mojolicious. Otherwise used as a handy tool for day to day automation as an admin or for simple webscraping tasks that do go beyond the usual sed/grep/awk toolchain, because it would be too complex.</p></li>
						<li><p><em>Shell(bash and sh):</em> usually taken as a scripting language for automation or simple scripting concerning initialization of a tasks, services and building fullblown Operating Systems</p></li>
						<li><p><em>Elisp:</em> As a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU EMACS</a> user it is normal to write the configuration and applications for it in Elisp I personally developed a binding to mocp from EMACS</li>
						<li><p><em>Delphi:</em> As a student and a intern I used this language to support and enhance a legacy application internal to the company I had my internship with</p></li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
			<li><p>During my time as admin apprentice and privately I used a variety of Operating Systems to manage and provide services to customers or myself:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p><em>Windows:</em> Starting out as a small time developer I learned programming on a Windows XP System using Visual Studio</p></li>
					<li><p><em>OpenSuse:</em> since version 10.3 it was my personal Desktop and my entry into the World of *NIX based systems</p></li>
					<li><p><em>Debian:</em> Recommended to me by my first employer/internship coordinator I started learning to use Debian and got interested in packaging applications</p></li>
					<li><p><em>CentOS:</em> for a quick deployment of a standard application with only a minimal amount of configuration CentOS is one of the easiest to use linuxicys We use it at my current apprenticeship for fast setup and 
						installation of evaluated software or webservers concerned with caching</p></li>
					<li><p><em>Windows Server:</em> since my current apprenticeship is in a large ASP.Net based service provider I have to manage a great amount of uptodate or older windows servers. Mostly 2k8 R2 these days though</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<h3>Hardware Systems</h3>
			<li><p>Through my current job I came in contact with a lot of hardware and subsequent solutions to our problems</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p><em>HP DLxxx Servers:</em> We are a customer of HP systems and use a lot of heir hardware from Storage to Server technology and have been happy for most of the time with their solutions</p></li>
					<li><p><em>Cisco Switches:</em> Having completed the DHomesB Curriculum and using them for work as Ethernet Switches I used and administrated a couple of generations of their switching technology</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
