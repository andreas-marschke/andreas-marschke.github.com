            My name is Andreas Marschke. By day I'm an apprentice for systems integration.
            But by night I am a freesoftware enthusiast and hacker on a number of different
            and interesting topics.

            On this page you will find some basic information about who I am what
            I am interested in and what there is other than this page to find out about me.

          This is a lot of banter for little of facts. Let's get down to some basic facts:

            Thanks to my Job -- and because it tickles my fancy -- I did a reasonable
            amount programming. Here are a few of the programming languages and respective projects
            I produced in them:
            <div class='inlist' id='coding'>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Perl: To me, nothing beats the productivity and speed of development on a daily basis
                  if you just want to punch out a simple script that does something well but is too complex
                  to make it in simple shell. Here are some projects I created:
                  <div class='inlist' id='perl-coding'>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        basically everything under
                        <pre>perl/</pre>
                        in my
                        <a href='https://github.com/andreas-marschke/misc-tools/tree/master/perl'>
                          misc-tools
                        </a>
                        repository on Github. For the most part they are one-offs that where there to do
                        something quickly.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        for work I thought it was a cool idea to have a
                        <a href=''>
                          live graph of our monitoring system
                        </a>
                        churning away on checks for our servers. It actually has a more complex story but this
                        should do for now.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Since I like monitoring systems and knowing what is going on in my network I thought I
                        try playing around with
                        <a href='http://nmap.org/'>
                          nmap.
                        </a>
                        But since that has only a commandline client and I would like to process stuff coming out
                        of nmap I tried working with tools that would produce something usable. I used Perl for that
                        (obviously). But I was unhappy with the state most of them were in and the features they
                        provided. Besides the quality of the modules most of them were either dead code or needed a
                        rewrite to do really fancy stuff with them. So
                        <a href='https://github.com/andreas-marschke/libnet-nmap-perl'>
                          I built my own.
                        </a>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ul>
