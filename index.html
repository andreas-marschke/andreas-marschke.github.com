	    <h2>An Introduction</h2>
    </div>
									  
		<div class="content" id="intro">
			<p>My name is Andreas Marschke. By day I'm an apprentice for systems integration at my lovely employer 
			<a href="www.afterbuy.de">ViA Online ebay - Afterbuy</a>.If you live in Germany and use ebay once or twice,
		 	you've probably seen our logo.</p>
			<p>On this site I will talk a about myself, where I come from and what my interests are.
			If you'd like to recieve a professional bio, please have a look on
			my <a href="xing.com">xing page</a></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I will keep most of the notes on here concise. If you'd like more than that please 
			checkout my <a href="/blogs/">blog</a>. There I will ramble about the &mdash; mostly tech related &mdash;
			things I care about at the moment</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Please enjoy your stay!</p>

			<h2>Knowledge</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content" id="knowledge">
			<p>Here is a list of things I have learned and have been playing with in the past.</p>
			<div id="knowledge-list" class="list">
			<ul>
				<li><em>Nagios or anything forked from it:</em><p>I use it at my job and have used it on and
			 		off for private projects. See my <a href="misc-tools">misc-tools</a> repository for
					some smaller tools revolving around nagios or anything else I needed. For a more advanced tool
					I'm currently writing have a look at <a href="nagplot">nagplot</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li><em>Mojolicious:</em><p> I love using it, I love writing code in it. For a non-blocking perl-based 
 					web-framework for small and middle sized projects it's awesome.</p>
				</li>
				<li><em>Perl:</em><p> for a syntactically rather arcane programming language perl is awesome for just
					punching out your everyday tool you need <b>right now</b> and <b>just for this one purpose</b>. This &mdash;
					to me &mdash; makes it one of the most usefull languages in an everyday environment.</p>
				</li>
				<li><em>Debian GNU/Linux:</em> <p> In my previous apprentice ship I was employed by one of europes biggest
					open source supporters. We primarely used Debian or derivatives of Debian in order to accomplish things.
					This led to a intricate knowledge of the Debian GNU/Linux operating system which makes me a better admin
					nowadays.</p>
				</li>
				<li><em>Webdesign:</em> <p><i>No.</i> This website is not themed by any wordpress plugin and not run by 
					any thirdparty CMS based on any other programming language. This page is pure HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
					This is one of my newest crushes in technology. I like designing. I like designing software and interfaces.
				 	Theming things and building things. This page is one of them.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="top">
			<h2>Toolchest</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content" id="toolchest">
			<p>If you liked what I am and what I do maybe you want to go over to one of my projects and check them out.</p>
			<div id="toolchest-list" class="list">
				<ul>
					<li><em>Nagplot</em><p> A live monitoring frontend for Nagios or any other Monitoring service for that 
						matter. Just put it in use the plugin and tell it which graphs you want. After that you can layback and
						watch the graph go all day.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em>misc-tools</em><p>The type of script you punch out one dizzy, foggy night in april years ago
						when you just wanted to see a single line on your screen telling you one specific thing.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em>emacs-config</em><p>I like my EMACS. I like my emacs <em>a lot</em> when developing more than just
				 		simple scripts in Perl.</p>
					</li>
					<li><em>dotfiles</em> <p> Everything including the kitchen sink that fires my day to day console experience.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><em>libnet-nmap-perl</em> <p> A library I thought to develop a while ago in order to have a nicer 
						more OOP-alike frontend that is easily usable.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
